      %p
        I'm the current Director of Development at
        %a{:href => "http://chaione.com/"} ChaiONE
        in Houston, TX.
        I started out programming when I was 13, tinkering with QBASIC and creating simple games and screen-savers
        and eventually went on to received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of
        Houston.
      %p
        Currently, I'm interested in agile practices such as test-driven development, refactoring, continuous
        integration, domain driven design, and more.  I also frequently cover object-relational mapping concepts
        with NHibernate.
      %p
        My platforms of choice (in no particular order):  .NET, Rails, iPhone and my languages are:
        C#, Ruby, Objective-C, JavaScript, and Boo.

      %h3 Brandi - Website Designer
      %p
        While I can be credited for designing and doing front-end coding for the Code Camp site, I must
        admit that I wasted too much of my life reading comic books rather than learning about big shot development.
      %p
        This design was lovingly provided as a "Heck yeah! Free knowledge! I can get behind that!" for all of the
        Code Camp attendees. You all make the internet and technology world go round and for that, you should have
        something pretty to look at.
