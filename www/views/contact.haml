	%h3 In Brief:
	%p
		= "Code Camp Houston is a free day of sessions relating to software development organized by the "
		%a{:href => "committee"}> 2011 Committee
		= "."
		%strong< 
			The event is free to attend, but
			%a{:href => "registration.html"} registration
			is required.
	%p 
		A Code Camp follows these rules:
		%ul{:class => "camp-brief"}
			%li They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.
			%li Code Camps are always FREE for attendees.
			%li 
				The success of the Code Camps is that they are based on community content. All content that is delivered is original. 
				%strong All presentation content must be provided completely (including code) without any restriction.
			%li No Fluff â€“ Code Code Camps are about showing the code.
			%li 
				%strong All are welcome to attend and speak
				and do so without expectation of payment.
			%li The beauty of the Code Camp is that they always occur on weekends.
