	<h3>In Brief:</h3>
	
	<p>Code Camp Houston is a free day of sessions relating to software development organized by the <a href="committee.html">
	2011 Committee</a>. <strong>The event is free to attend, but <a href="registration.html">registration</a> is required.</strong></p>

	<p>A Code Camp follows these rules:

		<ul class="camp-brief">
			<li>They are meant to be a place for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always 
			based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</li>

			<li>Code Camps are always FREE for attendees.</li>

			<li>The success of the Code Camps is that they are based on community 
			content. All content that is delivered is original. <strong>All presentation content must be provided 
			completely (including code) without any restriction.</strong></li>

			<li>No Fluff â€“ Code Code Camps are about showing the code.</li>

			<li><strong>All are welcome to attend and speak</strong> and do so without expectation of payment.</li>

			<li>The beauty of the Code Camp is that they always occur on weekends.</li>
			
		</ul>
